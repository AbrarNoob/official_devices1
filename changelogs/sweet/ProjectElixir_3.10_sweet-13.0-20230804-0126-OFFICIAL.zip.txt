- Use latest MIUI 14.x firmware
- Use latest recovery (https://github.com/basamaryan/android_device_xiaomi_sweet-TWRP/releases/tag/R11.1_4) 
- To avoid issues people must clean flash with the latest OrangeFox recovery R11.1_4.
- Changing the kernel will probably lead to issues as custom kernels do not have the required commits.
